# Roget C++
This project is heavily based on and inspired by Jon Gjenset's Wordle solver
implemented in Rust. I decided that I would instead implement the program in 
C++. This project was made just for fun and likely has lots of bugs. It is MIT
licensed so feel free to make changes as you see fit.

## Dependencies
- GCC
- Make

## How to Run the Program
I only ever tested this program on a Fedora Linux machine and as such that is the only OS that
I can guarantee this program will run. However, it is very likely that this program will run fine
on most OS's seeing as it does not use any hard Linux dependencies.

The program is simply run by issuing the following command in the root of the project directory:
```
make
```
